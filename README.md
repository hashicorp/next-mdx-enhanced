# Next.js + MDX Enhanced

[![build status](https://img.shields.io/circleci/build/github/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced.svg?style=flat-square)](https://circleci.com/gh/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced)

Have you ever found yourself using [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) with [mdx](https://mdxjs.com) but craving the ability to use layouts for full mdx pages, and/or [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)? Well well my friend, you are in the right place, because that's exactly what this plugin will do for you! ðŸŒŸ

## Installation

Start with `npm i next-mdx-enhanced`. You can then instantiate it as a Next.js plugin as such:

```js
// next.config.js
const withMdxEnhanced = require('next-mdx-enhanced')

module.exports = withMdxEnhanced(/* options, see below */)(/* your normal nextjs config */)
```

Also, make sure to add `.mdx-data` to your `.gitignore` file, this is a directory generated as part of the optimization process for this plugin.

## Usage

Let's get right into an example. Say you have set up the plugin as above, and you have site for displaying some docs (or blog, etc) that you're working on that looks like this:

```
MyApp
â”œâ”€ pages
â”‚  â”œ index.jsx
â”‚  â”” docs
â”‚    â”œ intro.mdx
â”‚    â”” advanced.mdx
â”” next.config.js
```

You need a couple things here in order to get to reasonable functionality.

1. The `.mdx` must each render as a page
2. The `.mdx` pages must render within your site's common layout
3. You need to be able to create an index of each of the pages for easy navigation

The default mdx nextjs plugin takes care of point number one, but nothing else. This one knocks out all three. Let's get into how it's done.

## Options

```js
mdxEnhanced({
  layoutPath: 'somePath/otherPath',
  defaultLayout: true,
  fileExtensions: ['mdx'],
  remarkPlugins: [],
  rehypePlugins: [],
  extendFrontMatter: {
    process: mdxContent => {},
    phase: 'prebuild|loader|both'
  }
})
```

### layoutPath

> `string` | optional | **default: `/layouts`**

Directory used to resolve page layout when `layout` key present in front matter. Value is resolved relative to project root.

### defaultLayout

> `boolean` | optional

Set value to `true` to treat `index.[extension]` within `layoutPath` as the default layout for any `.mdx` file that a layout has not been specified for.

### fileExtensions

> `array` | optional | **default: `['mdx']`**

Array of file extensions that should be processed as MDX pages.

### remarkPlugins

> `array` | optional

Array of [remark plugins](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/plugins#using-remark-and-rehype-pluginsns) used to transform `.mdx` files

### rehypePlugins

> `array` | optional

Array of [rehype plugins](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/plugins#using-remark-and-rehype-pluginsns) used to transform `.mdx` files

### extendFrontMatter

> `object` | optional

| Property  | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `process` | `function` | A hook function whose return value will be appended to the processed front matter. This function is given access to the source `.mdx` content as the first parameter. |
| `phase`   | `string`   | Used to specify when to run the `process` function. Eligible values are `prebuild`, `loader`, `both`. Defaults to `both` if not specified.                            |

### scan

> `object` | optional

Object of scan objects containing the following parameters

| Property    | Type                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `pattern`   | `RegEx`                                    | A RegEx to use for scanning `.mdx` content, enables Layout customization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `transform` | `function(match: Array[]): any` _optional_ | An optional callback function that transforms the result of the match operation. This function is passed an Array of any matching `.mdx` content that is returned by [`content.match(pattern)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match#Return_value) operation utilizing the `pattern` RegEx. |

See ["Scanning MDX Content"](#scanning-mdx-content) for more details.

### onContent

> `function` | optional

A function that will run on build for each MDX page. All metadata and full text content are passed to this function as its only argument. Useful for indexing your content for site search or any other purpose where you'd like to capture content on build.

## Layouts

We can specify a layout for a given `.mdx` file using its front matter, as such:

```
---
layout: 'docs-page'
title: 'Intro Page'
---

Here's some *markdown* content!
```

When the plugin sees the `layout` key, it will go looking by default in `/layouts/{name}` -- so in this case, it will look for `/layouts/docs-page` -- the extension can be any of the [pageExtensions](https://nextjs.org/docs#configuring-extensions-looked-for-when-resolving-pages-in-pages) you have configured. In this case, let's just use `.jsx`. Running this code will give you an error that the layout file was not found, so let's create it:

```diff
MyApp
â”œâ”€ pages
â”‚  â”œ index.jsx
â”‚  â”” docs
â”‚    â”œ intro.mdx
â”‚    â”” advanced.mdx
+â”œâ”€ layouts
+â”‚  â”” docs-page.jsx
â”” next.config.js
```

And for the content of your layout, nice and easy:

```jsx
export default frontMatter => {
  return ({ children }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{frontMatter.title}</h1>
        {children}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

In this case, all front matter is passed in to the default export function as a javascript object, so here we use the page title to display at the top in an `h1`. The contents of the markdown file are passed in as `children` from the returned function, so wherever we drop `{children}` the markdown file contents will render.

Now after restarting, the page should render within your layout. Whoo!

There are some additional config options here, let's take a look:

## Front Matter

So, you now have mdx files rendering as pages within custom layouts, and this is amazing. But how do your users get to these pages? They will have to start with an "index page" of some sort. And often times, it's useful to give users the opportunity to navigate between pages within your layout. Let's set up both of these.

Remember this file tree?

```
MyApp
â”œâ”€ pages
â”‚  â”œ index.jsx
â”‚  â”” docs
â”‚    â”œ intro.mdx
â”‚    â”” advanced.mdx
â”œâ”€ layouts
â”‚  â”” docs-page.jsx
â”” next.config.js
```

Let's head over to the `index.jsx` page and make that our entry point.

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link'
import {frontMatter as introData} from './docs/intro.mdx'
import {frontMatter as advancedData} from './docs/advanced.mdx'

export default () => {
  return (<>
    <h1>Docs Index<h1>
    <ul>
      <li><Link href={formatPath(introData.__resourcePath)}><a>{introData.title}</a></Link></li>
      <li><Link href={formatPath(advancedData.__resourcePath)}><a>{advancedData.title}</a></Link></li>
    </ul>
  </>)
}

function formatPath(p) {
  return p.replace(/\.mdx$/, '')
}
```

There's a bit to parse here so let's take it step by step.

```jsx
import { frontMatter as introData } from './docs/intro.mdx'
import { frontMatter as advancedData } from './docs/advanced.mdx'
```

Here, we import _just the front matter_ from the file we want. We don't need the full docs, we just want to know the title and location so we can link to it. We do the same for both files in our docs. You can probably imagine this would become a little bit of a pain as more docs files are added. I'd recommend [this babel plugin](https://github.com/jescalan/babel-plugin-import-glob-array) to make it easier. Let's see how the code looks after a quick refactor using this plugin:

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link'
import {frontMatter} from './docs/*.mdx'

export default () => {
  return (<>
    <h1>Docs Index</h1>
    <ul>
      {frontMatter.map(page => {
        <li><Link href={formatPath(page.__resourcePath)}><a>{page.title}</a></Link></li>
      })}
    </ul>
  </>)
}

function formatPath(p) {
  return p.replace(/\.mdx$/, '')
}
```

...much better. And now all we need to do to add a page is to put it in the docs folder. Let's keep going:

```jsx
<li>
  <Link href={formatPath(page.__resourcePath)}>
    <a>{page.title}</a>
  </Link>
</li>
```

The only thing that should seem unfamiliar here is `__resourcePath` -- this is a special variable that is injected into the front matter for each file, which exposes the path of the file the front matter came from, relative to the root of your project. So the small `formatPath` function below formats the path as a link to its location that we can pass to nextjs' `<Link>` component.

And you can do the same thing in your layout file in order to allow easy links to other docs pages if needed.

> _Nerd Note:_ If you're a real sharp thinker, you may have noticed that it is seemingly impossible for this previous statement to be true, since importing a mdx file requires rendering into its layout, but its layout also requires all the other mdx files, which each require rendering into their layouts, etc. This is what some may call an infinite loop, and it is impossible. In reality, this plugin does a little dirty work under the hood to make this behavior possible. It also injects a babel plugin which extracts the front matter out to separate temporary files, then transforms any front matter imports into importing from the separate file, which breaks the loop.

## Scanning MDX Content

Sample `next.config.js` entry:

```js
// in next.config.js
withMdxEnhanced({
  scan: [
    {
      someImportantKey: {
        pattern: /<SomeComponent.*name=['"](.*)['"].*\/>/,
        transform: arr => arr[1] // Optionally get a specific value back via a function;
        // if `transform` is omitted, any and all matches will be returned in an array
    }
  ]
})
```

If an MDX page uses `<SomeComponent />`

```js
---
layout: 'docs-page'
title: 'Advanced Docs'
---

import SomeComponent from '../../components/SomeComponent'

This is some _really_ **advanced** docs content!

<SomeComponent name="Find this text" />

```

This will produce an `Array` of matches returned to your `Layout` by the plugin.

```js
__scans: {
  someImportantKey: ['Find this text']
}
```

Consume these values in the `Layout` with the `__scans` key that is passed in along with anything else the plugin has provided.

```jsx
export default plugIn => {
  const __scans = plugIn.__scans
  return function Layout({ children }) {
    return (
   <>
    {/*..begin Layout..*/}
        {__scans.someImportantKey && (
          <h1>{__scans.someImportantKey}</h1> // returns <h1>Find this text</h1>
        )}
    {/*..end Layout..*/}
  </>

```
